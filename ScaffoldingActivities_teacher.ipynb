You can also index an array in reverse with negative numbers. For example, an index of -1 accesses the last value of a list (very useful for when you don't yet know the length of a list!), -2 accesses the 2nd to last value, and so on and so forth. You can change the value of a certain index of a list by accessing the element and simply setting it equal to a different value. Lets do some basic practice.</p>\n",
